                An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes 
                risky. Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, 
                skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports.
                <br><br>
                Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a 
                greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.

            <p class="text">
                Biking (also known as bicycling or cycling) is the riding of bicycles (also cycles, or bikes) 
                for leisure or as part of competition. In many countries, the cycle is also an important mode of
                 transport, more so in Asia (especially in Southeast Asia) and Africa.
                <br><br>
                Among the many advantages of riding a bike, the foremost (and certainly the most 
                topical today) is that it is a bionetwork-friendly means of getting from A to B. Cycling is
                 non-polluting – both in terms of air and noise pollution – and does not release any greenhouse 
                 gases, thus helping reduce the carbon footprint of riders.

            </div>

            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, 
                free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness
                 or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing
                <br><br>
                The pilot is suspended in a seated harness and controls the wing via lines attached to 
                the trailing edge of the paraglider. These lines may be operated individually to turn the 
                paraglider or simultaneously to influence pitch and speed. Takeoff and landing are on foot and 
                usually occur on a hill or mountain. To launch, the pilot first inflates the wing by pulling it up
                 like a kite and then runs down the hillside until flying speed has been reached. Usually a speed of 
                 about 12 miles per hour (19 km per hour) is enough to launch the craft.

            </div>

            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a
                 board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the 
                 surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also
                  be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
                <br><br>
                Surfing can be done on various equipment, including surfboards, longboards,
                 stand up paddle boards (SUPs), bodyboards, wave skis, skimboards, kneeboards. Surfboards were originally made of solid wood and were 
                  large and heavy (often up to 370 cm (12 ft) long and having a mass of 70 kg (150 lb)). 
                  Lighter balsa wood surfboards (first made in the late 1940s and early 1950s) were a significant improvement, not only in portability, but also in increasing maneuverability.
